Currently a PhD candidate at Harbin Institution of Technology (HIT) with Prof. [Changhong Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wangch), my research is on heterogeneous swarm robotic system, multi-agents RL, and swarm intelligence, where I focus on how large heterogeneous teams of robots can use limited local information to complete tasks like localization, formation and task allocation. 

My Bachelor's degree is from Harbin Institution of Technology (HIT) in Harbin, China. A more detailed personal data can be found in my [CV](files/CV_BoLiu.pdf) OR [CV2](files/CV_BoLiu2.pdf).

Outside of the lab, I love spending time doing some sport, like playing aeromodelling, hiking, playing tennis and marathon!
