Currently a PhD candidate at Harbin Institution of Technology (HIT) with Prof. [Changhong Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wangch), my research is on * heterogeneous swarm robotic system *, where I focus on how large heterogeneous teams of robots can use limited local information to complete useful tasks like localization, formation and task allocation . 

My Bachelor's degree is from Harbin Institution of Technology (HIT) in Harbin, China. A more detailed chronology of my westward journey can be found in my [CV](files/CV_BoLiu.pdf).

Outside of the lab, I love spending time doing some sport, like playing aeromodelling, hiking, playing tennis or a long run!
